    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A nice homemade recipe for porkchops baked in sweet and sour sauce, goes great with rice or mashed potatoes and your choice of vegitables.</p>
    <p>This recipe makes enought sauce for 4 or 5 large porkchips but you can also substitute the pork for chicken breasts.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> 4 or 5 porkchops thawed optionally trim fat to preference</li>
        <li><strong>Ketchup:</strong> 2 Cups Standard store bought Ketchup.</li>
        <li><strong>BBQ sauce</strong>: 2 - 4 Tbsp  Original BBQ sauce more or less will be the main change to the flavor, vary amount or flavor to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> 1 Cup regular white vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong> 2 Cups Of your choice of yellow or golden brown sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Mustard powder:</strong> 1 Tbsp regular mustard powder, havent tried standard mustard but I would assume yellow mustard would work as a substitute</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>(Optional): I usually add some garlic powder and pepper. For a bit of spice some chili powder and cayenne powder works well but not enough to overwhelm.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Use a bit to thicken the sauce if desired.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375f</li>
        <li>Heat a pan to high and sear the porkchops, no need to cook them.</li>
        <li>Mix the sauce together and optionally use 1 or 2 tbsp flour to thicken as desired.</li>
        <li>Add seared meat to sauce in a baking dish ensure sauce gets both under and over the meat.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 min.</li>
        <li>Ensure meat is cooked to to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Let dish stand uncovered for a few min before serving.</li>
    </ol>
